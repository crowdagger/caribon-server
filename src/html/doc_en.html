        <h1>Documentation</h1>
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>The purpose of Caribon is to detect repetitions in your
        text. In order to do so, you just have to copy and paste a
        (portion of) a document in the input text area. This document
        will be pasted as HTML, so basic formatting should be
          preserved when you copy/paste your text, e.g. from LibreOffice.</p>
        <p>Caribon also provides some options to configure how the
        repetition detection works. Here are some details about
          them.</p>
        <h3>Language</h3>
        <p>Pretty easy to figure, as it's just the language of your
        text. It is important for two reasons. The first one is that
        Caribon internally uses a stemming library, which will detect
        when words are derived from the same stem: e.g. "eats", "eat"
        and "eating" will be considered the same word. (More
        information on how this stemming library works can be found on
        the <a href = "http://snowball.tartarus.org/">Snowball project
        website</a>.) The second reason is
        that for some languages (currently only french and english),
        Caribon provides a default list of words to ignore for
        repetition counting (e.g. in english "it", "a" and so on are
        on it) to avoid cluttering the result file.</p>
        <h3>Global and local repetitions</h3>
        <p>Currently, Caribon provides two complementary algorithms:
          local and global.</p>
        <div class = "row">
          <div class = "large-6 columns">
            <h3>Local algorithm</h3>
            <p>The local algorithm will consider words as repetitions
            if they appear relatively "closely" (this is determined by
            the <em>Max distance</em> parameter: two similar words
            will be considered as repetitions if the number of words
            between them is less than this distance. Caribon will
            underline local repetitions in <span style =
            "test-decoration: underline; color: green">green</span>,  <span style =
            "test-decoration: underline; color: orange">orange</span>
            and  <span style = "test-decoration: underline; color: red">red</span>
            according to the number of repetitions (green is still
              relatively OK, while red is bad).
            </p>
            <p>Parameters for local algorithm:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Max distance</strong> : sets the maximal
              number of words separating two repetitions; above that,
                they are no more considered a repetition ;
              </li>
              <li><strong>Local threshold</strong> : minimal number of
                local repetitions to underline a word. Why a float
                value for the threshold, instead of an integer one?
                Because the local repetition detector will underline
                words in different colors: green, orange and red
                according to the "severity" of the repetitions. So
                setting the threshold to 1.01 or 2.0 will not change
                which words are underlined, but they will be in orange
                or red more quickly in the first case. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class = "large-6 columns">
            <h3>Global algorithm</h3>
            <p>The global algorithm counts the apparition of each
            word on the full document, and consider them a repetition
            if the ratio (that is, the number of apparition of a given
            word divided by the total number of words) is superior to
            the <em>Global threshold</em> parameter. E.g., a global
            theshold of 0.01 means a word will be considered a global
            repetition if it counts for more than 1% of the words of
            the text. Caribon will underline global repetitions in
             <span style =
            "test-decoration: underline; color: blue">blue</span>. By default, the global algorithm is not activated,
            because it does not make sense for small text (if you give
            it a ten words sentence, each word will amout to 10% of
            the total number of words and will thus be labeled a
              global repetition).
            </p>
            <p>Parameters for global algorithm:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Global threshold</strong>: minimum ratio of
              a word in a text (number of occurences of this words divided by total
              number of words) to underline it.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Fuzzy string matching</h3>
        <p>Caribon uses a stemming library to detect words that are
        part of the same 'family'. It turns out that this algorithm is
        not always enough, and particularly it doesn't detect
        repetitions when there is a typo (e.g. "higlight" and
        "highlight" should probably be considered a repetition, even
        if it is mispelled in the first case). To solve this issue,
          there is the option of activating fuzzy string matching.</p>
        <p>If you do so, you must specify the <em>fuzzy
        threshold</em>. It takes avalue is a number between 0.0 and
        1.0 which represents the maximal 'difference' between two
        words until they are no more identical: a value of 0.2 means
        that two words must be at most "20% different" until they are
          no more considered the same.</p>
        <p>Internally, this algorithm uses the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein
        distance</a>
        (and more specifically the <a href = "https://crates.io/crates/edit-distance">Rust implementation by Florian
        Ebelling</a>) which computes a distance between two strings by
        estimating the number of insertions, deletions and
        permutations it require to go from one to another. E.g., "dog"
        and "dogs" have a distance of 1, while "dog" and "cat" have a
        distance of 3. This value is then divided by the length of the
        string to match, and two string are considered "identical"
        (or, at least, a repetition) when this value is less than the
          <em>fuzzy threshold</em>.
        <p>Fuzzy matching is practical, but you should not set
        the <em>fuzzy threshold</em> to a
        too high value, else you will have a lot of false
          positives. Empirically, 0.2 or 0.25 is a good choice.</p>
        <h3>Ignored words</h3>
        <p>Some words, like "a" or "the", are unavoidably repeated a
        lot and it doesn't make much sense to consider them a
        repetition. It is thus useful to ignore some words. Caribon
        provides a default list for english and french, but it is in
        all cases possible to add your own words to the list in
          the <em>Ignore following words</em> field.</p>
        <p>This list must be separated by either spaces or commas (or,
        actually, anything that isn't a letter). Basically, you should
        probably start with an empty list, and add the words that are
          marked as a repetition but you don't think should be.</p>
        <p>Another option for ignoring words is <em>Ignore proper
        nouns</em>. If sets to true, Caribon will try to ignore proper
        nouns. That is, a word will not count for repetition if it
        starts with a capital letter and is not at the beginning of a
          sentence.
